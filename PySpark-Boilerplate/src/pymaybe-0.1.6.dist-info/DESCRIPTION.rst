A Python implementation of the Maybe pattern.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install pymaybe

Getting Started
---------------

::

    from pymaybe import maybe
    first_name = maybe(deep_hash)['account']['user_profile']['first_name'].or_else("<unknown>")

Documentation
-------------
Maybe monad is a programming pattern that allows to treat None values that same way as non-none values.
This is done by wrapping the value, which may or may not be None to, a wrapper class.

The implementation includes two classes: *Maybe* and *Something*.
*Something* represents a value while *Nothing* represents a None value.
There's also a method *maybe* which wraps a regular value and and returns *Something* or *Nothing* instance.

::

    >>> maybe("I'm a value")
    "I'm a value"

    >>> maybe(None);
    None

Both *Something* and *Nothing* implement 4 methods allowing you to test their real value: *is_some*, *is_none*, *get* and *or_else*

::

    >>> maybe("I'm a value").is_some()
    True

    >>> maybe("I'm a value").is_none()
    False

    >>> maybe(None).is_some()
    False

    >>> maybe(None).is_none()
    True

    >>> maybe("I'm a value").get()
    "I'm a value"

    >>> maybe("I'm a value").or_else(lambda: "No value")
    "I'm a value"

    >>> maybe(None).get()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Exception: No such element

    >>> maybe(None).or_else(lambda: "value")
    'value'

    >>> maybe(None).or_else("value")
    'value'

In addition, *Something* and *Nothing* implement the Python magic methods allowing you to treat them as dictionaries:

::
    >>> nested_dict = maybe(nested_dict)
    >>> nested_dict['store']['name']
    'MyStore'

    >>> nested_dict['store']['address']
    None

    >>> nested_dict['store']['address']['street'].or_else('No Address Specified')
    'No Address Specified'

All other method calls on *Something* are forwarded to its real *value*:

::

    >>> maybe('VALUE').lower()
    'value'

    >>> maybe(None).invalid().method().or_else('unknwon')
    'unknwon'

Examples & Use Cases
--------------------

The Maybe pattern helps you avoid nasty try..except blocks.
Consider the following code:

::
    try:
        url = rss.load_feeds()[0].url.domain
    except (TypeError, IndexError, KeyError, AttributeError):
        url = "planetpython.org"

With Maybe you could simply do:

::

    url = maybe(rss).load_feeds()[0]['url'].domain.or_else("planetpython.org")

Getting the current logged in user's name.
Without maybe:

::

    def get_user_zipcode():
        address = getattr(request.user, 'address', None)
        if address:
            return getattr(address, 'zipcode', '')

        return ''

With maybe:

::

    def get_user_zipcode():
        return maybe(request.user).address.zipcode.or_else('')
